// Recover

// Go makes it possible to recover from a panic, by using the recover built-in
// function. A recover can stop a panic from aborting the program and let it
// continue with execution instead.

// An example of where this can be useful: a server wouldn't want to crash if
// one of the client connections exhibits a critical error. Instead, the
// server would want to close that connection and continue serving other
// clients. In fact, this is what Go's net/http does by default for HTTP
// servers.

package main

import "fmt"

// This function panics
func mayPanic() {
	panic("a problem")
}

func main() {

	// recover must be called within a deferred function. When the enclosing
	// function panics, the defer will activate and a recover call within
	// it will catch the panic.
	defer func() {

		// The return value of recover is the error raise in the call to
		// panic.
		if r := recover(); r != nil {
			fmt.Println("Recovered. Error:\n", r)
		}
	}()

	mayPanic()

	// This code will not run, because mayPanic panics. The execution of
	// main stops at the poinr of the panic and resumes in the deffered
	// closure.
	fmt.Println("After maypanic")
}
