// Panic

// A panic typically means something went enexpectedly wrong. Mostyle we use
// to fail fast on errors that shouldn't occur during normal operation, or
// that we aren't prepared to handle gracefully.

package main

import (
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
)

func main() {

	// We'll use panic throught this site to check for unexpected errors.
	// This is the only program on the site designed to panic
	panic("a problem")

	// A common use of panic is to abort if a function returns an error value
	// that we don't know how to (or want to) handle. Here's an example of
	// panicking if we get an unexpected error when creating a new file.
	path := filepath.Join(os.TempDir(), "file")
	_, err := os.Create(path)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}

// Running this program will cause it to panic, print an error message and
// goroutine traces, and exit with a non-zero status.

// When first panic in main fires, the program exits without reaching the
// rest of the code. If you'd like to see the program try to create a
// temp file, comment the first panic out

// Note that unlike some languages which use exceptions for handling of
// many errors, in Go it is idiomatic to user error-indication return
// values wherever possible.
